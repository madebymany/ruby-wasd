# Wasd

Wide Area Service Discovery

An implementation of the client side of [RFC 6763](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763), for unicast DNS setups. It's intended this will be used with AWS Route 53, but isn't limited to that.

Only tested on Ruby 2.0, but should work on newer versions too.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wasd'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wasd

## Usage

See tests for quick usage instructions, but it's not much code to read either. Once you've skimmed the RFC you should get it pretty quickly.
